# Platform notes (Windows)

Hard-won gotchas. Do not "fix" these back to the obvious-but-broken form.

## node-pty: use the prebuilt fork

Dependency is **`@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch`**, not upstream `node-pty`. Upstream fails to compile on Windows — winpty's gyp step runs `GetCommitHash.bat` from a git submodule that is absent in the npm tarball (`'GetCommitHash.bat' is not recognized`). The fork ships a prebuilt N-API Windows binary, so the Node-ABI prebuild loads fine under Electron. **Do not** add `electron-rebuild` or switch back to `node-pty`.

## PTY needs a full executable path

node-pty on Windows does **not** search `PATH`. Spawning bare `'claude'` throws `Error: File not found`. `resolveClaude()` runs `where claude` once and caches the absolute path. Keep using it.

## Electron BrowserWindow flags

`sandbox: false` is intentional — the preload requires the native node-pty module. Keep `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false`.

## curl dependency

Hook payloads are delivered with `curl` (ships with Windows 11). If hooks stop firing on a stripped-down machine, confirm `curl` is on PATH.
